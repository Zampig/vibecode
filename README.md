# ANIMATRIX ZONE

A nostalgic early 2000s style Matrix-themed landing page with digital rain animation.

## Description

- Matrix-style digital rain code animation in the background
- Monospace fonts and green-on-black color scheme
- Animated elements and glowing effects
- Cursor trails in Matrix green
- A visitor counter that never stops counting
- A loading bar that never quite finishes
- "Under Construction" graphics (a classic web element)
- Random Matrix quotes that appear on the screen
- Easter eggs and hidden features
- No scrolling required - everything fits on one page!
